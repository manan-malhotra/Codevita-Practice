"""
Some prime numbers can be expressed as a sum of other consecutive prime numbers.
â€¢	For example

o	5 = 2 + 3,
o	17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7,
o	41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13.
Your task is to find out how many prime numbers which satisfy this property are present in the range 3 to N subject to a constraint that summation should always start with number 2


S.no	Input	Output	Comment
1	20	2	(Below 20 there are two such members; 5 and 17) 5=2+3 17=2+3+65+7
